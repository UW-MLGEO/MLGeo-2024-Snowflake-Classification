The projectâ€™s end goal is being able to identify the class that a snowflake belongs to based on images collected from an investigation on snowstorms by the Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering Probe. The images are complemented by meteorological and navigation data to provide temperature and spatial/geographic information for the samples. This is a classic example of a classification problem, as it requires organizing observations from different categories into several well-defined groups based on their features. 

Although clustering will be used for exploratory analysis, the focus of the project is on supervised learning, as images in the training data set have labels that identify them as members of one class. Testing images also have labels to be able to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithms, but as in any other supervised learning methods, these are not available for the algorithm during training to prevent known results from influencing the classification.

The expected outcome of the project is the development of a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying snowflakes based on the images and additional information provided in the dataset. Applying machine learning methods to this dataset will hopefully enhance the accuracy of classification and save time and effort with respect to the often impractical and imprecise task of manual classification.
